### What I learned

Initially, I tackled this challenge without thinking too much about reusability and code efficiency. The challenge itself wasn't too difficult so finishing it wasn't the issue. Once I had created a "rough draft" of the app, I realized that there were too many overlapping styles and components that I had missed. So I went back and took the time to create utility styles and components that could be shared among most of the elements in the final app.

Hopefully, I'll get better at noticing elements that could essentially be slight modifications of each other. That way, I'll be able to create components efficiently, without having to write so much excess code.
